# Reprograma Backend

Bootcamp lasting 14 weeks of exclusive dedication, where I was challenged in projects with real job market scenarios that addressed front-end and back-end knowledge, such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, API and MongoDB, in addition to unit tests, agile methodologies and good programming practices.

The Reprogram is a social impact initiative that aims to train and integrate cis and trans women in the technology area. I was one of 36 women selected from more than 300 registrations to participate in the 8th class, with a back-end focus.

In addition to the programming content, mentoring sessions conducted by women technology professionals were carried out in major supporting companies, such as Google, LinkedIn, ThoughtWorks, Accenture, Nubank and Creditas.
